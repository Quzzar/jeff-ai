# Jeff, My Home AI Assistant

Meet Jeff, he's a homie ðŸ¤™
![Jeff!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Quzzar/jeff-ai/main/public/npcs/1.png 'Jeff')

He's my home assistant I built to control all my lights, tv, fireplace, etc. He's also powered by GPT-3.5 so he can do everything that can as well. He's powered by the npm package I made for simple AI conversation flows, [Vocalmind](https://github.com/Quzzar/vocalmind).

## TODO

- In the future, it would be smart to move over to use OpenAI's functions. This is the perfect application for it.
